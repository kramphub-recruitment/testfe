# Assignment

Build an application to show characters from “Game of Thrones”. Your mission is to show characters from “Game of Thrones” in a table with several functionalities.
The API to be used is from [https://anapioficeandfire.com/]. Documentation about the API is available there as well.

In the application, we would appreciate seeing the following functionalities:

- Pagination (max 10 on a page)
- Filtering on different columns (text filter on the table)
- Sort ordering on different columns
- We expect to get an idea about the age of the character. The current API does not have this data available. You could guess this on the first name by using [https://agify.io] API.

Bonus:
- Try to minimize requests sent to the API (back button not fetching data again)
- Use a CSS framework of your choice to style your components. Build this application with React. Make sure the application is production ready and well-documented.
